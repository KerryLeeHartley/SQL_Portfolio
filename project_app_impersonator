/* What does the app's SQL look like? */

/*Think about your favorite apps, and pick one that stores your data- like a game 
that stores scores, an app that lets you post updates, etc. 
Now in this project, you're going to imagine that the app stores your data 
in a SQL database (which is pretty likely!), and write SQL statements 
that might look like their own SQL.
CREATE a table to store the data.
INSERT a few example rows in the table.
Use an UPDATE to emulate what happens when you edit data in the app.
Use a DELETE to emulate what happens when you delete data in the app.*/

CREATE TABLE toggl (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    name TEXT,
    task TEXT,
    minutes INTEGER);

INSERT INTO toggl (name, task, minutes) VALUES ("Kerry", "cooking", 50);
INSERT INTO toggl (name, task, minutes) VALUES ("Ashley", "driving", 15);
INSERT INTO toggl (name, task, minutes) VALUES ("Scooby", "running", 30);
INSERT INTO toggl (name, task, minutes) VALUES ("pyhton code", "working", 60);

Select * FROM toggl;

UPDATE toggl set name = "Kerry"
WHERE id = 3;

Select * FROM toggl;

DELETE FROM toggl
WHERE id = 4;

Select * FROM toggl;
