/* Create table about the people and what they do here */

/**In this project, you’re going to make your own table with some small 
set of “famous people”, then make more tables about things they do and join 
those to create nice human readable lists. Contains at least two tables with at 
least 15 rows total. One of the tables contains a column that relates to the primary key of another table.
Has at least one query that does a JOIN.*/
